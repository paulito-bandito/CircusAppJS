Date: 	Dec 24 2013

This is a in-class tutorial which may prove useful idea (JavaScript needs to be updated) for other instructors on teaching material.  

I created for my undergraduate students (at the Rochester Institute of Technology) to highlight Polymorphism, Event Handling, and Single Responsibility Principal in JavaScript. 

See this repository to see how it was linked to introducing the students on how to use a command line build tool (NodeJS's Grunt): https://github.com/paulito-bandito/GruntBuild

Please note that this example doesn't include prototypes which would have been the next part.

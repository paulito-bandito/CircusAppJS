# Circus App: SIMPLE JavaScript Application In-Class Example.
Author:	Paul Walter
Date: 	Dec 24 2013

This is a in-class tutorial I created for my undergraduate students (at the Rochester Institute of Technology) to highlight Polymorphism, Event Handling, and Single Responsibility Principal in JavaScript. 

See this repository to see how it was linked to introducing the students on how to use a command line build tool (NodeJS's Grunt): https://github.com/paulito-bandito/GruntBuild

Please note that this example doesn't include prototypes which would have been the next part.
